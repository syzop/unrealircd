 * Special remote include caching, see this Changelog item:
 * - Added special caching of remote includes. When a remote include fails to
 *   load (for example when the webserver is down), then the most recent
 *   version of that remote include will be used, and the ircd will still boot
 *   and be able to rehash. Even though this is quite a simple feature, it
 *   can make a key difference when deciding to roll out remote includes on
 *   your network. Previously, servers would be unable to boot or rehash when
 *   the webserver was down, which would be a big problem (often unacceptable).
 *   The latest version of fetched urls are cached in the cache/ directory as
 *   cache/<md5 hash of url>.
 *   Obviously, if there's no 'latest version' and an url fails, the ircd will
 *   still not be able to boot. This would be the case if you added or changed
 *   the path of a remote include and it's trying to fetch it for the first time.
 * There usually is no reason to disable this.
