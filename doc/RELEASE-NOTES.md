UnrealIRCd 5.0.0-beta1 Release Notes
======================================

***IMPORTANT:*** UnrealIRCd 5 is currently in "beta" phase. This means it
**may crash** or behave weird. Do not run this on production servers!

The fact that UnrealIRCd 5 is "beta" means it's mostly feature-complete.
Now it's time to test things thoroughly and get rid of bugs.
For those users who do dare to run it, feel free to report any issues
on https://bugs.unrealircd.org/.

***WARNING:*** if you are using anope, then you must run anope 2.0.7
(or later) with the unreal4 protocol module. If you are using git, then `git pull` in the Anope cloned repo and recompile Anope

Summary
--------
The most visible change to end-users is channel history. A lot of IRCv3 features were added.
Various modules from Gottem have been integrated and enhanced.
We now have a 3rd party module manager so you can install modules with 1 simple command.
Channel settings of ```+P``` channels and *LINES are saved in a database and
restored on startup (via 'channeldb' and 'tkldb' respectively).
Channel mode ```+L``` has a slight change of meaning, the existing floodprot
mode (```+f```) has a new type to prevent repeated messages and a new drop action.
A few extended bans have been added as well (```~f``` and ```~p```).
IRCOps now have the ability to add ban exceptions via the ```/ELINE``` command.
Advanced admins can use more dynamic configuration options where you can
define variables and use them later in the configuration file.
Finally, there have been speed improvements, we use better defaults and
have added more countermeasures and options against spambots.
Under the hood *a significant amount* of the source code was changed and cleaned up.

Read below for the full list of enhancements, changes and removals (and information for developers too).

Enhancements
-------------
* Support for IRCv3 server generated [message tags](https://ircv3.net/specs/extensions/message-tags), which allows us to communicate
  additional information in protocol messages such as in JOIN and PRIVMSG.
  Currently implemented and permitted message tags are:
  * [account](https://ircv3.net/specs/extensions/account-tag-3.2): communicate the services account that a user uses
  * [msgid](https://ircv3.net/specs/extensions/message-ids): assign an unique message id to each message
  * [time](https://ircv3.net/specs/extensions/server-time-3.2): assign a time label to each message
  The last two are mainly for history playback.
* Support for IRCv3 [echo-message](https://ircv3.net/specs/extensions/echo-message-3.2), which helps clients, among other things,
  to see if the message you sent was altered in any way, eg: censored,
  stripped from color, etc.
* Support for IRCv3 [draft/labeled-response-0.2](https://ircv3.net/specs/extensions/labeled-response), which helps clients to
  correlate commands and responses.
* Support for IRCv3 [BATCH](https://ircv3.net/specs/extensions/batch-3.2), needed for some other features.
* Recording and playback of [channel history](https://www.unrealircd.org/docs/Channel_history) when channel mode +H is set.
  The syntax is: ```MODE #chan +H max-lines-to-record:max-time-to-record-in-minutes```.

  For example: ```MODE #chan +H 50:1440``` means the last 50 messages will be stored and no
  message will be stored longer than 1440 minutes (1 day).

  The channel history is then played back when joining such a channel,
  but with two things to keep in mind:
  1) The client must support the 'server-time' CAP ('time' message tag),
     otherwise history is not shown. Any modern IRC client supports this.
  2) Only a maximum of 15 lines are played back on-join by default

  The reason for the maximum 15 lines on-join playback is that this can
  be quite annoying if you rejoin repeatedly and as to not flood the users
  screen too much (unwanted). In the future we will support a mechanism
  for clients to "fetch" history - rather than sending it on-join - so
  they can fetch more than the 15 lines, up to the number of lines and
  time configured in the +H channel mode.

  You can configure the exact number of lines that are played back and
  all the limits that apply to +H via [set::history::channel](https://www.unrealircd.org/docs/Set_block#set::history).
* For saving and retrieving history we currently have the following options:
  * *history_backend_mem*: channel history is stored in memory.
    This is very fast but also means history is lost on restart.
  * *history_backend_null*: don't store channel history at all.
    This can be useful to load on servers with no users on it, such as a
    hub server, where storing history is unnecessary.

  As you can see there is currently no 'disk' backend. However, in the
  future more options may be added. Also note that 3rd party modules
  can add history backends as well.
* Support for ban exceptions via the new ```/ELINE``` command. This allows you
  to add exceptions for regular bans (KLINE/GLINE/ZLINE/etc), but also
  for connection throttling and blacklist checking.
  For more information, just type ```/ELINE ``` in your IRC client as an IRCOp.
* [Websocket](https://www.unrealircd.org/docs/WebSocket_support) support now includes type 'text'
  in addition to 'binary', which should work with [KiwiIRC](https://kiwiirc.com/)'s nextclient.

  Also, websockets are longer active on all ports by default. You have to explicitly
  enable the websocket option in the listen block and also specify type *text* or *binary*,
  eg: ```listen { ip *; port 6667; options { websocket { type text; } } }```

  Also note that websockets require nick names and channels to consist of UTF8
  characters only, due to
  [WebSocket being incompatible with non-UTF8](https://www.unrealircd.org/docs/WebSocket_support#Problems_with_websockets_and_non-UTF8)
* There's now a [Module manager](https://www.unrealircd.org/docs/Module_manager)
  which allows you to install and upgrade 3rd party modules in an easy way:
  * ```./unrealircd module list``` - to list all available 3rd party modules
  * ```./unrealircd module install third/something``` - to install the specified module.
* You can now test for configuration errors without actually starting the
  IRC server. This is ideal if you are upgrading UnrealIRCd to a newer
  version: simply run ```./unrealircd configtest``` to make sure it passes
  the configuration test, and then you can safely restart the server for
  the upgrade (in this example case).
* Channel mode +L now kicks in for any rejected join, so not just for +l but
  also for +b, +i, +O, +z, +R and +k. If, for example, the channel is
  +L #insecure and also +z then, when an insecure user ties to join, they
  will be redirected to #insecure.
* New extended ban ~f to forward users to the specified channel if the ban
  matches. Example: ```MODE #chan +b ~f:#badisp:*!*@*.isp.org```
* Channel mode +f now has a 'd' action: drop message. This will send an
  error message to the user and not show the message in the channel but
  otherwise do nothing (no kick or ban).
  For example: ```MODE #chan +f [5t#d]:15``` will limit sending a maximum of
  5 messages per 15 seconds per-user and drop any messages sent above that limit.
* Channel mode +f now has 'r' floodtype to prevent repeated lines. This will
  compare the current message to the last message and the one before that
  the user sent to the channel. If it's a repeat then the user can be
  kicked (the default action), the message can be dropped ('d') or the
  user can be banned ('b'). Example: ```MODE #chan +f [1r#d]:15```
  If you want to permit 1 repeated line but not 2 then use: ```+f [2r#d]:15```
* New module **tkldb** (loaded by default): all *LINES and spamfilters are now
  saved across reboots. No need for services for that anymore.
* New module **channeldb** (loaded by default): saves and restores all channel
  settings including topic, modes, bans etc. of +P (persistent) channels.
* New module [restrict-commands](https://www.unrealircd.org/docs/Set_block#set::restrict-commands), which allows you to restrict any IRC
  command based on criteria such as "how long is this user connected",
  "is this user registered (has a services account)" etc.
  The example.conf now ships with configuration to disable LIST the
  first 60 seconds and disable INVITE the first 120 seconds.
  If you are having spambot problems then tweaking this configuration
  may be helpful to you.
* New option [set::require-module](https://www.unrealircd.org/docs/Set_block#set::require-module), which allows you to require certain
  modules on other UnrealIRCd 5 servers, otherwise the link is rejected.
* New option [set::min-nick-length](https://www.unrealircd.org/docs/Set_block#set::min-nick-length) to set a minimum nick length.
* New module rmtkl (loaded by default): this allows you to remove TKL's
  such as GLINEs easily via the /RMTKL command.
* The [reputation and connthrottle](https://www.unrealircd.org/docs/Connthrottle) modules are now loaded by default.
  Just as a reminder, what these do is classifying your users in "known
  users (known IP's)" and "unknown IP's" for IP's that have not been
  seen before (or only for a short amount of time). Then, when there
  is a connection flood, unknown/new IP addresses are throttled at
  20 connections per minute, while known users are always allowed in.
* Add support for [defines and conditional configuration](https://www.unrealircd.org/docs/Defines_and_conditional_config) via @define and @if.
  This is mostly for power users, in particular users who share the same
  configuration file across several servers.
* New extban ~p to hide the part/quit message in PART and QUIT.
  For example: ```MODE #chan +b ~p:*!*@*.nl```
* You will now see a warning when a server is not responding even
  before they time out. How long to wait for a PONG reply upon PING
  can be changed via [set::ping-warning](https://www.unrealircd.org/docs/Set_block#set::ping-warning) and defaults to 15 seconds.
  If you see the warning frequently then your connection is flakey.
* Add new setting [set::broadcast-channel-messages](https://www.unrealircd.org/docs/Set_block#set::broadcast-channel-messages) which defines when
  channel messages are sent across server links. The default setting
  is *auto* which is the correct setting for pretty much everyone.
* Add new option [set::part-instead-of-quit-on-comment-change](https://www.unrealircd.org/docs/Set_block#set::part-instead-of-quit-on-comment-change):
  when a QUIT message is changed due to channel restrictions, such as
  stripping color or censoring a word, we normally change the QUIT
  message. This has an effect on ALL channels, not just the one that
  imposed the restrictions. While we feel that is the best tradeoff,
  there is now also this new option (off by default) that will change
  the QUIT into a PART in such a case, so the other channels that
  do not have the restrictions (eg: are -S and -G) can still see the
  original QUIT message.
* New module [webredir](https://www.unrealircd.org/docs/Set_block#set::webredir::url). Quite some people run their IRCd on port 443 or 80
  so their users can avoid firewall restrictions in place. In such a case,
  with this module, you can now send a HTTP redirect in case some user
  enters your IRC server name in their browser. Eg https://irc.example.org/
  can be made to redirect to https://www.example.org/
* We now protect against misbehaving SASL servers and will time out
  SASL sessions after
  [set::sasl-timeout](https://www.unrealircd.org/docs/Set_block#set::sasl-timeout),
  which is 15 seconds by default.

Changed
--------
* Channel names must now be valid UTF8 by default.
  We actually have 3 possible settings of [set::allowed-channelchars](https://www.unrealircd.org/docs/Set_block#set::allowed-channelchars):
  * **utf8**:  Channel must be valid UTF8, this is the new default
  * **ascii**: A very strict setting, for example in use at freenode,
     the channel name may not contain high ascii or UTF8
  * **any**:   A very loose setting, which allows almost all characters
     in the channel name. This was the OLD default, up to and
     including UnrealIRCd 4. It is no longer recommended.

  For most networks this new default setting of utf8 will be fine, since
  by far most IRC clients use UTF8 for many years already.
  If you have a network that has a significant portion of chatters
  that are on old non-UTF8 clients that use a specific character set
  then you may want to use ```set { allowed-nickchars any; }```
  Some Russian and Ukrainian networks are known to need this.
* The "except tkl" block is now called [except ban](https://www.unrealircd.org/docs/Except_ban_block#UnrealIRCd_5). If no type
  is specified in an except ban { } block then we exempt the entry
  from kline, gline, zline, gzline and shun.
* We no longer use a blacklist for stats (set::oper-only-stats).
  We use a whitelist now instead: [set::allow-user-starts](https://www.unrealircd.org/docs/Set_block#set::allow-user-stats).
  Most users can just remove their old set::oper-only-stats line,
  since the new default set::allow-user-starts setting is fine.
* Windows: we now require a 64-bit version, Windows 7 or later.
  The new program path is: C:\Program Files\UnrealIRCd 5
  and the binaries have been moved to a new subdirectory: bin\
* Modules lost their m_ prefix, so for example m_map is now just map.
  Also the modules in cap/ are now directly in modules.
* More modules that were previously PERM (permanent) can now be unloaded
  and reloaded on the fly. This allows more "hotfixing" without restart
  in case of a bug and also more control for admins at runtime.
  Only <5 modules out of 173 are permanent now.
* User mode +T now blocks channel CTCPs as well.
* [set::modes-on-join](https://www.unrealircd.org/docs/Set_block#set::modes-on-join) is now ```+nt``` by default.
* The [authprompt](https://www.unrealircd.org/docs/Authentication#How_it_looks_like) module is now loaded by default. This means that if
  you do a soft kline on someone (eg: KLINE %*@*.badisp) then the user
  has a chance to [authenticate](https://www.unrealircd.org/docs/Authentication#How_it_looks_like) to services, even without SASL, and
  bypass the ban if (s)he is authenticated.
* The WHOX module is now used by default. Previously it was optional.
  WHOX enhances the "WHO" output, providing additional information to
  IRC clients such as the services account that someone is using.
  It is also more universal than standard WHO. Unfortunately this also
  means the WHO syntax changed to something less logical.
* At many places the term *SSL* has been changed to *SSL/TLS* or *TLS*.
  Configuration items (eg: set::ssl to set::tls) have been renamed
  as well and so have directories (eg: conf/ssl to conf/tls).
  The old configuration names still work and currently does NOT raise
  any warning. Also, when upgrading an existing installation on *NIX,
  the conf/tls directory will be symlinked to conf/ssl as to not break
  any Let's Encrypt certificate scripts.
* It is now mandatory to have at least one open SSL/TLS port, otherwise
  UnrealIRCd will refuse to boot. Previously this was a warning.
* IRCOps now need to use SSL/TLS in order to oper up, as the
  [set::plaintext-policy::oper](https://www.unrealircd.org/docs/Set_block#set::plaintext-policy) default setting is now 'deny'.
  Similarly, [set::outdated-tls-policy::oper](https://www.unrealircd.org/docs/Set_block#set::outdated-tls-policy) is now also 'deny'.
* [set::outdated-tls-policy::server](https://www.unrealircd.org/docs/Set_block#set::outdated-tls-policy) is now 'deny' as well, since all
  servers should use reasonable SSL/TLS protocols and ciphers.
* The default generated certificated has been changed from RSA 4096 bits
  to Elliptic Curve Cryptography "384r1". This provides the same amount
  of security but at higher speed. This only affects the default self-
  signed certificate. You can still use RSA certificates just fine.
* If you do use an RSA certificate, we now require it to be at least
  2048 bits otherwise UnrealIRCd will refuse to boot.
* When matching [allow { } blocks](https://www.unrealircd.org/docs/Allow_block), we now always continue with the next
  block (if any) if the password did not match or no password was
  specified. In other words, allow::options::nopasscont is now the
  default and we behave as if there was a ::wrongpasscont too.
* All snomasks are now oper-only. Previously some were not, which
  was confusing and could lead to information leaks.
  Also removed weird set::snomask-on-connect accordingly.
* The IRCd now uses hash tables that are resilient against hash table
  attacks. Also, the hash tables have increased in size to speed things
  up when looking up nick names etc.
* Server options in VERSION (eg: Fhin6OoEMR3) are no longer shown to
  normal users. They don't mean much nowadays anyway.
* ```./Config``` now asks fewer questions and configure runs faster since
  many unnecessary checks have been removed (compatibility with very
  old compilers / systems).
* We now default to system libs (eg: ```--with-system-pcre2``` is assumed)
* Spamfilter should catch some more spam evasion techniques.
* All /DCCDENY and deny dcc { } parsing and checking is now moved to
  the 'dccdeny' module.

Minor issues fixed
-------------------
* Specifying a custom OpenSSL/LibreSSL path should work now

Removed
--------
* Support for old server protocols has been removed.
  This means UnrealIRCd 5.x cannot link to 3.2.x. It also means you need
  to use reasonably new services. Generally, if your services can link to
  4.x then they should be able to link to 5.x as well. More information
  about this change and why it was done
  [can be found here](https://www.unrealircd.org/docs/FAQ#old-server-protocol).
* Extended ban ~R (registered nick): this was the old method to match
  registered users. Everyone should use ~a (services account) instead.
* The old TRE **posix** regex method has been removed because the TRE
  library is no longer maintained for over a decade and contains many
  bugs. (It was already deprecated in UnrealIRCd 4.2.3).
  Use type **regex** instead, which uses the modern PCRE2 regex engine.
* Timesync support has been removed. Use your OS time synchronization
  instead. (Note that Timesync was already disabled by default in 2018)
* Changing time offsets via ```TSCTL OFFSET``` and ```TSCTL SVSTIME``` are no longer
  supported. Use your OS time synchronization (NTP!). Adjustments via
  TSCTL are simply not accurate enough.
* The *nopost* module was removed since it no longer serves any useful
  purpose. UnrealIRCd already protects against these kind of attacks
  via ping cookies ([set::ping-cookie](https://www.unrealircd.org/docs/Set_block#set::ping-cookie), enabled by default).

Deprecated
-----------
* The set::official-channels block is now deprecated. This provided a
  mechanism to pre-configure channels that would have 0 members and
  would appear in /LIST with those settings, but once you joined all
  those settings would be gone. Rather confusing.

  Since UnrealIRCd 4.x we have permanent channels (+P) and since 5.x
  we store these permanent channels in a database so all settings are
  saved every few minutes and across restarts.

  Since permanent channels (+P) are much better, the official-channels
  support will be removed in a later version. There's no reason to
  use official-channels anymore.

Developers
-----------
IMPORTANT: As long as UnrealIRCd 5 is in alpha stage, we do not suggest
3rd party module authors to start porting modules yet from U4 to U5.
Of course you may, but the module API is still very likely to change
so you may have to do certain (other) changes again next alpha release.
It is therefore best to wait until beta1. You have been warned ;).
* The module header is now as follows:

      ModuleHeader MOD_HEADER
        = {
              "nameofmodule",
              "5.0",
              "Some description", 
              "Name of Author",
              "unrealircd-5",
          };
  There's a new author field, the version must start with a digit,
  and also the name of the module must match the loadmodule name.
  So for example third/funmod must also be named third/funmod.
* The ```MOD_TEST```, ```MOD_INIT```, ```MOD_LOAD``` and ```MOD_UNLOAD``` functions no longer
  take a name argument. So: ```MOD_INIT(mymod)``` is now ```MOD_INIT()```
* In UnrealIRCd 5, during development, ```--enable-asan``` is ON by default
  to catch more bugs. This also means an up to 10x slowdown and more
  memory usage. When we reach 5.0.0 stable this will be turned off.
* We now use our own BuildBot infrastructure, so Travis-CI and AppVeyor
  have been removed.
* We now use a new test framework.
* ```Auth_Check()``` now returns ```1``` for allow and ```0``` on deny (!!)
* New function ```new_message()``` which should be called when a new message
  is sent, or at least for all channel events. It adds (or inherits)
  message tags like 'account', 'msgid', 'time', etc.
* Many send functions now take an extra MessageTag *mtags parameter,
  including but not limited to: sendto_one() and sendto_server().
* Command functions (CMD_FUNC) have an extra ```MessageTag *mtags```,
  on the other hand the ```cptr``` parameter has been removed.
* Command functions no longer return ```int``` but are ```void```,
  the same is true for  ```exit_client()```. ```FLUSH_BUFFER``` has been removed too.
  All this is a consequence of removing this (limited) signaling
  of client exits. From now on, if you call ```exit_client()``` it will free
  a lot of the client data and exit the user (close socket, send [s]quit),
  but it will **not free 'sptr' itself**, so you can simply check if some
  upstream function killed the client by checking ```IsDead(sptr)```.
  This is highly recommended after running ```do_cmd()``` or calling other
  functions that could kill a client. In which case you should return
  rather than continue doing anything with ```sptr```.
  Ultimately, in the main loop, the client will be freed (normally in less than 1 second).
* New single unified ```sendto_channel()``` and ```sendto_local_common_channels()```
  functions that are used by all the channel commands.
* Numerics should now be sent using ```sendnumeric()```. There's also
  a format string version ```sendnumericfmt()``` in case you need it.
* The parameters in several hooks have changed. Many now have an
  extra ```MessageTag *mtags``` parameter. Sometimes there are other changes
  as well, for example ```HOOKTYPE_CHANMSG``` now has 4 extra parameters.
* If you ever send a timestamp in a printf-like function, such as
  in ```sendto_server()```, then be sure to use ```%lld``` and cast the timestamp
  to *long long* so that it is compatible with both *NIX and Windows.
  Example: ```sendnotice(sptr, "Timestamp is %lld", (long long)ts);```
* ```EventAdd()``` changed the order of parameters and expects every_msec now
  which specifies the time in milliseconds rather than seconds. This
  allows for additional precision, or at least multiple calls per second.
  The minimum allowed every_msec value is 100 at this time.
  The prototype is now: ```EventAdd(Module *module, char *name,
  vFP event, void *data, long every_msec, int count);```
* New ```HOOKTYPE_IS_HANDSHAKE_FINISHED```. If a module returns ```0``` there, then
  the ```register_user()``` function will not be called and the user will
  not come online (yet). This is used by CAP and some other stuff.
  Can be useful if your module needs to "hold" a user in the registration
  phase.
* The function ```is_module_loaded()``` now takes a relative path like
  "usermodes/noctcp" because with just "ctcp" one could not see the
  difference between usermodes/noctcp and chanmodes/noctcp.
* ```CHFL_CHANPROT``` is now ```CHFL_CHANADMIN```, ```is_chanprot()``` is now ```is_chanadmin()```
* All hash tables now use [SipHash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SipHash), which is a hash function that is
  resilient against hash table attacks. If you, as a module dev, too
  use any hash tables anywhere (note: this is quite rare), then you
  are recommended to use our functions, see the functions siphash()
  and siphash_nocase() in src/hash.c.
* The random generator has been updated to use [ChaCha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salsa20#ChaCha20_adoption) (more modern).
* You can now save pointers and integers etc. across rehashes by using
  ```LoadPersistentPointer()``` and ```SavePersistentPointer()```. For an example,
  see ```src/modules/chanmodes/floodprot.c``` how this can be used.
  Note that there can be no struct or type changes between rehashes.
* New ModData types: ```MODDATA_LOCALVAR``` and ```MODDA_GLOBALVAR```. These are
  settings or things that are locally or globally identified by the
  variable name only and not attached to any user/channel.
* Various files have been renamed. As previously mentioned, the m_
  prefix was dropped in ```src/modules/m_*.c```. Similarly the s_ prefix
  was dropped in ```src/s_*.c``` since it no longer had meaning. Also some
  files have been deleted and integrated elsewhere or renamed to
  have a name that better reflects their true meaning.
  Related to this change is that all command functions are now called
  ```cmd_name``` rather than ```m_name```.
* ```HOOKTYPE_CHECK_INIT``` and ```HOOKTYPE_PRE_LOCAL_CONNECT```
  have their return value changed. You should now return ```HOOK_*```, such
  as ```HOOK_DENY``` or ```HOOK_CONTINUE```.

Server protocol
----------------
* UnrealIRCd 5 now assumes you support the following PROTOCTL options:
  ```NOQUIT EAUTH SID NICKv2 SJOIN SJ3 NICKIP TKLEXT2```.
  If you fail to use ```SID``` or ```EAUTH``` then you will receive an
  error. For the other options, support is *assumed*, no warning or
  error is shown when you lack support. These are options that most,
  if not all, services support since UnrealIRCd 4.x so it shouldn't be
  a problem. More information (here)[https://www.unrealircd.org/docs/FAQ#old-server-protocol]
* ```PROTOCTL MTAGS``` indicates that the server is capable of handling
  message tags and that the server can cope with 4K lines. (Note that
  the ordinary non-message-tag part is still limited to 512 bytes).
* Pseudo ID support in SASL was removed. We now use real UID's.
  This breaks anope, up to 2.0.6 stable, due lacking
  [this patch](https://github.com/anope/anope/commit/da6e2730c259d6d6356a0a948e85730ae34663ab.patch)

Client protocol
----------------
TODO: expand with other new things / changes
* When a message is blocked, for whatever reason, we now use a generic
  numeric response: ```:server 531 yourname targetname :reason``` for the block
  This replaces all the various NOTICEs, ```ERR_NOCTCP```, ```ERR_NONONREG```, etc.
  with just one single numeric.
  The only other numerics that you may still encounter when PM'ing are
  ```ERR_NOSUCHNICK```, ```ERR_TOOMANYTARGETS``` and ```ERR_TARGETTOOFAST```, which are
  generic errors to any command involving targets. And ```ERR_SERVICESDOWN```.
  Note that channel messages already had a generic numeric for signaling
  blocked messages for a very long time, ```ERR_CANNOTSENDTOCHAN```.
